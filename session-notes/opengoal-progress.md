## What's In Main (v1.1.0)

### UI Restructure
- **Level panel** (parent, always open): name, ID, death plane at top
  - Level Flow sub-panel: spawns, checkpoints, bsphere preview
  - Level Manager sub-panel: custom level list, remove/refresh
  - Light Baking sub-panel: vertex color bake
  - Music sub-panel: music bank + sound bank 1/2 selectors
- **Spawn panel** (parent, DEFAULT_CLOSED):
  - Enemies sub: filtered dropdown (enemies + bosses only), inline navmesh link
  - Platforms sub: platform spawn + active platform settings
  - Props & Objects sub: filtered dropdown
  - NPCs sub: filtered dropdown
  - Pickups sub: filtered dropdown
  - Sound Emitters sub: pick sound, add emitter, emitter list
- **Triggers**: always visible (no DEFAULT_CLOSED)
- **Waypoints**: context-sensitive (shows when enemy/platform actor selected)
- **Camera, Build & Play, Dev Tools, Collision**: unchanged

### Features working (confirmed in Blender 4.4)
- ✅ Camera position + rotation export (quaternion formula confirmed)
- ✅ Trigger volumes (AABB, entity-actor, births on level load)
- ✅ Camera switch on enter, revert on exit
- ✅ Look-at target (interesting lump)
- ✅ FOV, blend time, mode (fixed/standoff/orbit)
- ✅ Sound emitters (looping ambients, confirmed working with village1 bank)
- ✅ Music bank + sound bank export in level-info.gc
- ✅ Platform sync/path/phase export
- ✅ Navmesh link UI (inline in Enemies sub-panel)
- ✅ Per-category entity dropdowns (each sub-panel shows only its types)
- ✅ All 37 static analysis checks pass

## Camera Quaternion Formula (confirmed working)

```python
m3 = cam_obj.matrix_world.to_3x3()
bl_look = -m3.col[2]
gl = Vector((bl_look.x, bl_look.z, -bl_look.y))
gl.normalize()
game_down = Vector((0, -1, 0))
right = gl.cross(game_down).normalized()
if right.length < 1e-6: right = Vector((1,0,0))
up = gl.cross(right).normalized()
gq = Matrix([right, up, gl]).to_quaternion()
qx, qy, qz, qw = -gq.x, -gq.y, -gq.z, gq.w  # conjugate
```

## Known Limitations / Future Ideas

### Sound emitters
- One-shot sounds crash (engine bug: `lookup-tag-idx 'exact 0.0` on tags at `-1e9`)
- Only looping ambients work via the ambient system
- Music is triggered by `set-setting! 'music` not the music-bank field directly

### Navmesh
- NavMesh panel removed — navmesh link UI now inline in Enemies sub-panel
- og.mark_navmesh, og.unmark_navmesh, og.pick_navmesh operators still registered
  but have no panel UI (orphaned pre-existing operators, harmless)

### Entity picker
- `entity_type` kept in sync for export compatibility when sub-panel spawns entities
- source_prop on SpawnEntity operator routes to correct per-category prop

### Future features (wanted)
- **Load boundaries** — add support for `load-boundary` entries (modifying `load-boundary-data.gc`). Base game uses these for checkpoints (71 of 170 boundaries use `cmd = checkpt`). Has `fwd`/`bwd` directional crossing support unlike the current actor-based checkpoint-trigger. Requires engine-side edits, not just JSONC — addon could export boundary code snippets.

### Optimization ideas (not urgent)
- Tfrag chunking system (see opengoal-progress.md §Future Branch Ideas)
- Music ambient zones (type='music ambient)
- Sound emitter volume/pitch/falloff controls
- One-shot sounds (requires upstream OpenGOAL fix)
